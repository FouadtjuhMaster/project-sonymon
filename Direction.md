**the intended direction for this homebrew to take**

-If anything, I do not want **sonymon** to become **pokemon**. That is not what this project is about. If I wanted to make a pokemon homebrew I would have just used premade art and sounds and maps, and this project would be a whole lot simplet. No, the aim of this project is to create a game _similar_ to pokemon. This is what we keep in mind while we continue to work on it.

-As of the time of this writing sonymon is around **15000** lines of code and uses around **9/10 MB** of files to run.... its not a simple homebrew to make.

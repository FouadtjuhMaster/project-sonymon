Project Sonymon is a role-playing game
After 9 beta releases, the first "stable" Sonymon version was released on Dec 31, 2011 for the Sony PSP. However, we are heading a whole new direction with this. With new innovative ideas, concepts and stories it will be anything different than you are used to.

As you can see, there is a PSP download in the download section. But don't think the game is still in that direction. We have decided to do something rather unique, and are planning to make a game that has quality above quantity.
